CLASSIFICATION RULES
- If the question clearly refers to one or more specific sub-scenarios, include their scenario numbers.
- If the question is related to payment but does not clearly specify a sub-scenario (e.g., "How much do I need to pay?",
"What are my costs?"), return only: 1
- A single question may map to multiple sub-scenarios.
- If the question is not related to payment, return an empty list.
- Do NOT infer medical services, coverage rules, networks, or eligibility. Only classify payment intent.
